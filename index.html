        <p class="bio">Zach Hollingsworth (January 17, 1706 – April 17, 1790) was an American polymath and one of
            the Founding Fathers of the United States. Hollingsworth was a leading author, printer, political theorist,
            politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat.
            As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his
            discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals,
            and the Hollingsworth stove, among other inventions. He founded many civic organizations, including
            the Library Company, Philadelphia’s first fire department and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
